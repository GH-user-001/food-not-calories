# Welcome to Your Calorie Tracker!

This spreadsheet is designed to help you easily track your daily food intake, monitor your calorie consumption against your personal targets, and plan your meals. Here's how to get started:

---

## 1. Setting Up Your "User Profile"

The **"User Profile"** sheet is where you personalize your tracker. This information helps tailor the tracker to your needs and preferences.

*   **Navigate to the "User Profile" sheet.**
*   **Favorite Foods:**
    *   In the "Favorite Foods" section, list foods you frequently eat or particularly enjoy. This can be a quick reference for meal ideas.
*   **Allergies:**
    *   Under "Allergies," note down any food allergies or intolerances you have. This is important for your health and dietary choices.
*   **Health Conditions:**
    *   Use the "Health Conditions" section to list any conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Hypertension) that might influence your diet or calorie needs.
*   **Daily Calorie Target:**
    *   This is a crucial field! Enter your desired daily calorie intake in the "Target Calories" cell (e.g., `2000`). This target will be used in the "Today's Log" sheet to show you how many calories you have remaining for the day.

## 2. Logging Your Meals in "Today's Log"

The **"Today's Log"** sheet is where you'll record everything you eat and drink throughout the day.

*   **Navigate to the "Today's Log" sheet.**
*   For each item you consume, fill out a new row:
    *   **Time:** Enter the time you ate (e.g., `8:00 AM` or `14:30`).
    *   **Food Item:** Describe the food or drink (e.g., `Banana`, `Chicken Salad Sandwich`).
    *   **Calories:** Input the number of calories for that item (e.g., `105`, `350`).
    *   **Notes/Fun Fact (Optional):** Add any relevant notes, how you felt, or a fun fact about the food.
    *   **Meal Type:** Select the appropriate meal from the dropdown list (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack).

## 3. Planning Ahead with "Next Day Plan"

The **"Next Day Plan"** sheet helps you think about and organize your meals for the following day. This can be a great way to stay on track with your goals.

*   **Navigate to the "Next Day Plan" sheet.**
*   The structure is identical to "Today's Log."
*   Fill out the columns (`Time`, `Food Item`, `Calories`, `Notes`, `Meal Type`) with what you *plan* to eat.
*   This allows you to see your anticipated calorie intake for the next day and make adjustments as needed.

## 4. Understanding Calorie Tracking

The spreadsheet automatically helps you monitor your calorie intake:

*   **Automatic Summation:** In the "Today's Log" sheet (usually in cells `E1:F1` or similar, at the top), you'll see "Total Calories Today:". This automatically sums up all the calories you've entered for the current day.
*   **Target Comparison:**
    *   "Daily Calorie Target:" (usually in `E2:F2`) displays the target you set in your "User Profile".
    *   "Remaining Calories:" (usually in `E3:F3`) subtracts your "Total Calories Today" from your "Daily Calorie Target". This tells you how many calories you have left for the day, or if you've gone over your target (it will show a negative number).
*   **Stay Updated:** Ensure your "Daily Calorie Target" in the "User Profile" is accurate for these calculations to be meaningful.
